        It is certain
        It is decidedly so
        Without a doubt
        Yes definitely
        You may rely on it
        As I see it, yes
        Most likely
        Outlook good
        Yes
        Signs point to yes
        Reply hazy, try again
        Ask again later
        Better not tell you now
        Cannot predict now
        Concentrate and ask again
        Donâ€™t count on it
        My reply is no
        My sources say no
        Outlook not so good
        Very doubtful
